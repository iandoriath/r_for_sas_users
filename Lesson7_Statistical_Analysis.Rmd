# Introduction

Welcome to Lesson 7 of our curriculum for SAS users learning R! In this lesson, we'll explore statistical analysis in R, from basic descriptive statistics to more complex modeling techniques. As a SAS user, you're familiar with procedures like PROC TTEST, PROC GLM, and PROC LOGISTIC. R offers similar capabilities through functions, with a more flexible and interactive approach.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Perform basic descriptive statistics and hypothesis tests in R
2. Conduct ANOVA and fit linear regression models
3. Implement logistic regression for binary outcomes
4. Perform basic survival analysis
5. Interpret statistical results in R
6. Understand the parallels between SAS procedures and R functions

# Creating Sample Data

Let's create a sample clinical trial dataset to work with throughout this lesson:

```{r}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Create a clinical trial dataset
clinical_trial <- data.frame(
  PatientID = 1:100,
  Age = round(rnorm(100, mean = 55, sd = 10)),
  Sex = factor(sample(c("Male", "Female"), 100, replace = TRUE)),
  Treatment = factor(sample(c("Placebo", "Drug A", "Drug B"), 100, replace = TRUE)),
  Baseline_BP = round(rnorm(100, mean = 140, sd = 15)),
  Final_BP = NA,  # We'll calculate this based on treatment effect
  Cholesterol = round(rnorm(100, mean = 200, sd = 25)),
  Outcome = factor(NA, levels = c("Failure", "Success"))  # Binary outcome
)

# Add treatment effects
clinical_trial$Final_BP <- clinical_trial$Baseline_BP + 
  ifelse(clinical_trial$Treatment == "Placebo", rnorm(100, -5, 10),
         ifelse(clinical_trial$Treatment == "Drug A", rnorm(100, -15, 10),
                rnorm(100, -25, 10)))  # Drug B has strongest effect

# Create binary outcome based on BP reduction
clinical_trial$Outcome <- factor(
  ifelse(clinical_trial$Final_BP < clinical_trial$Baseline_BP - 10, "Success", "Failure"),
  levels = c("Failure", "Success")
)

# Calculate BP change
clinical_trial$BP_Change <- clinical_trial$Final_BP - clinical_trial$Baseline_BP

# View the first few rows
head(clinical_trial)
```

# Descriptive Statistics and Hypothesis Tests

## Descriptive Statistics

In SAS, you might use PROC MEANS or PROC UNIVARIATE for descriptive statistics. In R, there are several approaches:

```{r}
# Basic summary statistics
summary(clinical_trial[, c("Age", "Baseline_BP", "Final_BP", "BP_Change")])

# Group-wise statistics using dplyr
clinical_trial %>%
  group_by(Treatment) %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    mean_age = mean(Age),
    mean_baseline_bp = mean(Baseline_BP),
    mean_final_bp = mean(Final_BP),
    mean_bp_change = mean(BP_Change),
    sd_bp_change = sd(BP_Change)
  )
```
> **Summarize Again:** Run these chunks. Compare the base R `summary()` output to the detailed, grouped summary created with `dplyr`. Both are useful for initial exploration.


## Two-Sample t-test

In SAS, you would use PROC TTEST. In R, we use the `t.test()` function:

```{r}
# Compare BP change between Placebo and Drug B
placebo_data <- clinical_trial %>% filter(Treatment == "Placebo")
drugB_data <- clinical_trial %>% filter(Treatment == "Drug B")

t_test_result <- t.test(placebo_data$BP_Change, drugB_data$BP_Change)
t_test_result
```
> **Run the t-test:** Run this chunk. The `t_test_result` object contains detailed information. Printing it shows the key results like the p-value and confidence interval. Compare this output format to the typical SAS PROC TTEST output.


Let's compare this to what you would see in SAS:

**SAS PROC TTEST:**
```
proc ttest data=clinical_trial;
  class Treatment;
  var BP_Change;
  where Treatment in ("Placebo", "Drug B");
run;
```

The R output provides:
- The t-statistic
- Degrees of freedom
- p-value
- Confidence interval for the difference in means
- Sample means

This is similar to what PROC TTEST provides, though the format is different.

## Chi-Square Test

For categorical data, SAS uses PROC FREQ with the CHISQ option. In R, we use `chisq.test()`:

```{r}
# Create a contingency table
outcome_table <- table(clinical_trial$Treatment, clinical_trial$Outcome)
outcome_table

# Perform chi-square test
chi_sq_result <- chisq.test(outcome_table)
chi_sq_result
> **Chi-Square Test:** Run this chunk. First, create the `outcome_table` using `table()`. Then, run `chisq.test()` on the table. Examine the output for the test statistic and p-value.

```

Let's visualize this relationship:

```{r}
# Bar plot of outcomes by treatment
ggplot(clinical_trial, aes(x = Treatment, fill = Outcome)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Outcomes by Treatment",
       y = "Proportion",
       x = "Treatment Group") +
  theme_minimal()
```
> **Visualize Proportions:** Run this `ggplot` chunk. This plot helps visualize the proportions tested by the chi-square test.


# ANOVA and Linear Models

## One-Way ANOVA

In SAS, you would use PROC GLM or PROC ANOVA. In R, we can use `aov()` or `lm()`:

```{r}
> **Run ANOVA:** Run this chunk. Both `aov()` and `lm()` followed by `anova()` give you the ANOVA table. Examine the F-statistic and p-value to see if there's a significant difference in `BP_Change` across treatment groups.

# One-way ANOVA using aov()
anova_result <- aov(BP_Change ~ Treatment, data = clinical_trial)
summary(anova_result)

# Same analysis using lm()
lm_anova <- lm(BP_Change ~ Treatment, data = clinical_trial)
anova(lm_anova)
```

The output shows:
- Degrees of freedom
- Sum of squares
- Mean squares
- F-value
- p-value

This is similar to the ANOVA table from PROC GLM in SAS.

## Post-hoc Tests
> **Post-hoc Tests:** Run this chunk. `TukeyHSD()` performs pairwise comparisons. Look at the `p adj` column to see which specific group differences are statistically significant.


For pairwise comparisons after ANOVA, SAS might use the LSMEANS statement with adjustments. In R, we can use `TukeyHSD()`:

```{r}
# Tukey's Honest Significant Difference
tukey_result <- TukeyHSD(anova_result)
tukey_result
```

## Linear Regression

In SAS, you would use PROC REG or PROC GLM. In R, we use `lm()`:

```{r}
> **Linear Regression:** Run these chunks. First, fit a simple model (`lm_simple`), then a multiple regression model (`lm_multiple`). Use `summary()` on each to see the coefficients, R-squared, and p-values.

# Simple linear regression
lm_simple <- lm(Final_BP ~ Baseline_BP, data = clinical_trial)
summary(lm_simple)

# Multiple linear regression
lm_multiple <- lm(Final_BP ~ Baseline_BP + Age + Treatment, data = clinical_trial)
summary(lm_multiple)
```

The output includes:
- Coefficients with standard errors, t-values, and p-values
- R-squared and adjusted R-squared
- F-statistic and overall p-value

This is similar to the output from PROC REG in SAS, though the format is different.

## Visualizing the Model

Let's visualize the relationship between baseline and final BP, colored by treatment:

```{r}
> **Visualize Regression:** Run this `ggplot` chunk. This helps visualize the relationship fitted by the linear model, showing separate lines for each treatment group.

ggplot(clinical_trial, aes(x = Baseline_BP, y = Final_BP, color = Treatment)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Baseline and Final BP",
       x = "Baseline BP (mmHg)",
       y = "Final BP (mmHg)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Extracting Model Information

In SAS, you might use ODS OUTPUT to capture model results. In R, we can use the `broom` package to tidy model outputs:

```{r}
# Get tidy coefficient table
tidy(lm_multiple)
> **Tidy Models:** Run these chunks using the `broom` package. `tidy()` gives a nice data frame of coefficients. `glance()` provides model summary statistics. `augment()` adds fitted values and residuals back to the original data. These are very useful for extracting model results programmatically.


# Get model performance metrics
glance(lm_multiple)

# Get fitted values and residuals
augment(lm_multiple) %>% head()
```

## Diagnostic Plots
> **Diagnostic Plots:** Run this chunk (you might need to click 'Next Plot' in the Plots pane to see all four). These standard plots help assess the assumptions of the linear model (linearity, normality of residuals, homoscedasticity).

> **Logistic Regression:** Run this chunk. We use `glm()` with `family = binomial`. Examine the `summary()` output for coefficients and p-values.


In SAS, you might use the PLOTS option in PROC REG. In R, we can use the built-in `plot()` function or create custom plots:

```{r}
# Basic diagnostic plots
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(lm_multiple)
```

# Logistic Regression

In SAS, you would use PROC LOGISTIC. In R, we use `glm()` with `family = binomial`:

```{r}
# Logistic regression
logistic_model <- glm(Outcome ~ Treatment + Age + Baseline_BP, 
> **Odds Ratios:** Run this chunk. Exponentiating the coefficients (`exp(coef(...))`) gives the odds ratios. `confint()` provides confidence intervals, which we also exponentiate.

                      family = binomial(link = "logit"), 
                      data = clinical_trial)
summary(logistic_model)
```

The output includes:
- Coefficients with standard errors, z-values, and p-values
- AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)
- Null and residual deviance

This is similar to the output from PROC LOGISTIC in SAS, though the format is different.

## Odds Ratios

In SAS, PROC LOGISTIC provides odds ratios directly. In R, we need to exponentiate the coefficients:

```{r}
# Calculate odds ratios and confidence intervals
> **Predicted Probabilities:** Run this chunk. `predict(..., type = "response")` gives the predicted probability of success for each patient. The plot helps visualize how these probabilities vary.

exp(cbind(OR = coef(logistic_model), confint(logistic_model)))
```

## Predicted Probabilities

Let's calculate and visualize predicted probabilities:

```{r}
# Add predicted probabilities to the dataset
clinical_trial$predicted_prob <- predict(logistic_model, type = "response")

# Plot predicted probabilities by treatment
ggplot(clinical_trial, aes(x = Baseline_BP, y = predicted_prob, color = Treatment)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Predicted Probability of Success by Baseline BP",
       x = "Baseline BP (mmHg)",
       y = "Predicted Probability of Success") +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Survival Analysis

Survival analysis is common in biomedical research. In SAS, you would use PROC LIFETEST and PROC PHREG. In R, we use the `survival` package.

Let's create a survival dataset:
> **Survival Data:** Run this chunk to create the sample `survival_data`.


```{r}
# Create a survival dataset
set.seed(456)
n <- 200
survival_data <- data.frame(
  PatientID = 1:n,
  Treatment = factor(sample(c("Placebo", "Drug A", "Drug B"), n, replace = TRUE)),
  Age = round(rnorm(n, mean = 60, sd = 12)),
  Time = NA,
  Status = NA
)

# Generate survival times based on treatment
# Placebo: baseline hazard
> **Kaplan-Meier Fit:** Run this chunk. `Surv()` creates the survival object. `survfit()` calculates the KM estimates. Examine the `summary(km_fit)` output to see survival probabilities at different time points.

# Drug A: 20% reduction in hazard
# Drug B: 40% reduction in hazard
survival_data$Time <- round(rexp(n, rate = ifelse(survival_data$Treatment == "Placebo", 1/20,
                                           ifelse(survival_data$Treatment == "Drug A", 1/25, 1/33))))

# Add censoring (about 30% of patients)
survival_data$Status <- sample(c(1, 0), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.7, 0.3))

# View the first few rows
> **Plot KM Curves:** Run this chunk. `ggsurvplot` creates a publication-ready KM plot, complete with confidence intervals, p-value, and risk table. Very handy!

head(survival_data)
```

## Kaplan-Meier Curves

In SAS, you would use PROC LIFETEST. In R, we use `survfit()`:

```{r}
# Create a survival object
surv_obj <- Surv(time = survival_data$Time, event = survival_data$Status)
> **Cox Model:** Run this chunk. `coxph()` fits the proportional hazards model. Check the `summary()` output for coefficients, hazard ratios (exp(coef)), and p-values.


# Fit Kaplan-Meier curves by treatment
km_fit <- survfit(surv_obj ~ Treatment, data = survival_data)

# Summary of the Kaplan-Meier fit
summary(km_fit)

# Plot Kaplan-Meier curves
ggsurvplot(km_fit, data = survival_data, 
           pval = TRUE,  # Add p-value from log-rank test
           risk.table = TRUE,  # Add risk table
           conf.int = TRUE,  # Add confidence intervals
           xlab = "Time (months)",
           ylab = "Survival Probability",
           title = "Kaplan-Meier Curves by Treatment Group")
```
> **Tidy Cox Model:** Run this chunk. `tidy()` with `exponentiate = TRUE` gives a nice data frame of hazard ratios and confidence intervals.


## Cox Proportional Hazards Model

In SAS, you would use PROC PHREG. In R, we use `coxph()`:

```{r}
# Fit Cox proportional hazards model
cox_model <- coxph(surv_obj ~ Treatment + Age, data = survival_data)
summary(cox_model)
```

The output includes:
> **Forest Plot:** Run this `ggplot` chunk. This plot visually represents the hazard ratios and their confidence intervals from the Cox model.

- Coefficients with standard errors, z-values, and p-values
- Hazard ratios (exp(coef)) with confidence intervals
- Concordance, likelihood ratio test, Wald test, and score (logrank) test

This is similar to the output from PROC PHREG in SAS.

## Hazard Ratios

Let's extract and visualize the hazard ratios:

```{r}
# Extract hazard ratios and confidence intervals
cox_tidy <- tidy(cox_model, exponentiate = TRUE, conf.int = TRUE)
cox_tidy

# Forest plot of hazard ratios
ggplot(cox_tidy, aes(x = estimate, y = term, xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbarh(height = 0.2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(title = "Hazard Ratios with 95% Confidence Intervals",
       x = "Hazard Ratio (log scale)",
       y = "") +
  theme_minimal()
```

# SAS vs R: Statistical Analysis Comparison

Let's summarize the key differences and similarities between SAS and R for statistical analysis:

| Analysis | SAS | R |
|----------|-----|---|
| Descriptive statistics | PROC MEANS, PROC UNIVARIATE | summary(), mean(), sd(), etc. |
| t-test | PROC TTEST | t.test() |
| Chi-square test | PROC FREQ with CHISQ | chisq.test() |
| ANOVA | PROC GLM, PROC ANOVA | aov(), lm() |
| Linear regression | PROC REG, PROC GLM | lm() |
| Logistic regression | PROC LOGISTIC | glm() with family = binomial |
| Survival analysis | PROC LIFETEST, PROC PHREG | survfit(), coxph() |

Key differences:
1. **Output format**: SAS produces formatted tables, while R returns objects that can be further manipulated.
2. **Interactivity**: R allows for more interactive exploration of results.
3. **Visualization**: R makes it easier to create customized visualizations of results.
4. **Model objects**: In R, model results are stored as objects that can be examined, extracted, and used in further analyses.
5. **Default output**: SAS often provides more comprehensive output by default, while R requires explicit requests for specific information.

# Exercises

## Exercise 1: t-test and Visualization

Use the `t.test()` function on the `BP_Change` variable comparing "Drug A" and "Drug B" treatment groups. **Type your code in the chunk below and run it.** Interpret the output: what is the p-value and confidence interval? Is the difference statistically significant? Create a boxplot to visualize the difference.

```{r}
# Your code here
```

*Your interpretation here*

## Exercise 2: ANOVA and Linear Regression

Perform a one-way ANOVA to compare `Cholesterol` across the three treatment groups. **Type your code in the chunk below and run it.** Check the ANOVA table and note the F-statistic and p-value. Then perform a linear regression with `Cholesterol` as the outcome and `Age`, `Sex`, and `Treatment` as predictors. **Add this code to the chunk and run it.** Identify the coefficients and their p-values, and write a short interpretation.

```{r}
# Your code here
```

*Your interpretation here*

## Exercise 3: Logistic Regression

Fit a logistic regression model with `Outcome` as the dependent variable and `Treatment`, `Age`, and `Baseline_BP` as predictors. **Type your code in the chunk below and run it.** Show the summary and compute odds ratios. Determine if treatment group has a significant effect on the odds of success.

```{r}
# Your code here
```

*Your interpretation here*

# Conclusion

In this lesson, you've learned how to perform statistical analysis in R, from basic descriptive statistics to more complex modeling techniques like linear regression, logistic regression, and survival analysis. You've seen how these approaches compare to similar procedures in SAS, and how to interpret the results.

Key takeaways:
- R provides functions for all common statistical analyses that you might perform in SAS
- The formula interface (outcome ~ predictors) is used consistently across different types of models
- Model results in R are stored as objects that can be examined and manipulated
- R makes it easy to visualize data and model results
- The statistical concepts and interpretations are the same, even though the syntax differs

In the next lesson, we'll explore advanced topics including mixed models, Bayesian analysis, high-performance computing, and creating interactive applications with Shiny.
